"July 1, 2023",Valenciaport establishes hydrogen pathway for European ports,"Valenciaport attended the Clean Hydrogen Alliance CEO conference in Brussels, where it highlighted the hydrogen projects that are now ongoing and will pave the path for the rest of European ports to emulate similar efforts. The conference was attended by Joan Calabuig, president of the Port Authority of Valencia, and Josep Sanz, director of Energy Transition and Sustainability at the Valenciaport Foundation. The goal of this event, which brought together the most innovative port institutions in the use of this fuel in Belgium, is to select a portfolio of feasible ideas that will be prioritised in future hydrogen implementation. In this regard, one of the pillars on which Valenciaport builds its environmental policy is the use of green hydrogen, which the European Union has identified as a preferable energy in the construction of important projects to expedite industrial decarbonisation. During the conference, Valenciaport presented the success of two of the three projects that comprise the H2Ports initiative, as well as the operation of the third (a hydrogen-powered reach stacker truck that will begin operation this July). In the first example, Valenciaport is the world's first port to test the use of hydrogen in real operations in a tractor unit outfitted with a set of fuel cells used in ro-ro terminal loading/unloading operations. In the second example, a transportable hydrogen station has been installed. The intention to construct two hydrogen valleys - one in Valencia for mobility uses and one in Sagunto for industrial uses - was also addressed at this conference. ""They are an example of how the promotion of synergies can make projects with this green fuel affordable,"" stated Josep Sanz.",https://container-news.com/valenciaport-establishes-hydrogen-pathway-for-european-ports/,2023-07-01

"June 30, 2023",BIMCO calls on vessel owners as Bangladesh and Liberia ratify HK Convention,"The International Maritime Organization (IMO), Bangladesh, and Liberia have announced the ratification of the Hong Kong Convention by both nations. BIMCO believes the ratification marks the beginning of a new era for the ship recycling industry. During the two-year interim period, ahead of the entry in force, BIMCO is calling on shipowners to choose globally compliant yards for the benefit of the industry’s workers and the environment. The ratification comes at a vital moment for the primary recycling states, such as India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, since more than 15,000 ships are expected to be recycled over the next 10 years, according to BIMCO predictions. In addition, BIMCO thinks that the ratification welcomes a new era for the ship recycling sector. Bangladesh and Liberia have both ratified the Hong Kong Convention, according to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). ""14 years ago, 63 nations adopted the Hong Kong Convention. Today, Bangladesh and Liberia have paved the way for the convention to enter into force. This commitment from Bangladesh and Liberia is more than just a step in the right direction, it is a leap that will benefit the environment and workers in the ship recycling industry. The Hong Kong Convention entering into force means that a fully sustainable ship-recycling industry is possible and within reach,” stated David Loosley CEO & Secretary General of BIMCO. BIMCO has consistently advocated for the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships, or Hong Kong Convention, to enter into effect, and applauds the 20 states that have already ratified. Bangladesh expressed its willingness to ratify the convention this year during a visit to Chattogram and Dhaka in early May by BIMCO and other organisations to examine the advantages of ratifying the agreement. ""We will continue to call on shipowners to commit to choosing globally compliant yards when their ships reach the end of their life cycle,” noted Loosley. According to BIMCO's statement, over three and a half years, the Hong Kong Convention was created in collaboration with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Basel Convention parties. It was accepted in 2009 by 63 nations and tackles topics such as safety, suitable working conditions, environmental concerns, and how to deal with dangerous products. The Hong Kong Convention has yet to be ratified by a sufficient number of states to enter into force.",https://container-news.com/bimco-calls-on-vessel-owners-as-bangladesh-and-liberia-ratify-hk-convention/,2023-06-30
"June 29, 2023",Congestion at Mundra Port hits vessel productivity for carriers,"The congestion plaguing India’s Mundra Port over the past week continues to cause multiple operational troubles for container lines working on Indian trades, according to industry sources. Because of the logjam that developed after Cyclone Biparjoy-related disruptions, the port has been operating on an erratic berthing window system. Carriers, offering regular calls at Mundra, have had challenges connecting all planned container loads due to gate restrictions. A trade notice issued by Maersk this week is evidence of that concern. “We tried to extend cut offs, for which we have sent an advisory with revised cut off but due to congestion at the port, the terminal is not accepting the revised cut-off,” the carrier said. “We are not able to accept any more cargo on the current vessel (CMA CGM Lebu 325W).” Maersk has also noted similar loading restrictions on the sailing Lana 325S and said boxes left behind would be rolled over to the next vessel Maersk Brooklyn. CMA CGM also told customers that its current sailing on the MIDAS2 service, the CMA CGM Quelimane, is being delayed in its call at Mundra. “Customers are requested to plan the shipments accordingly,” the French liner noted. The Container Shipping Lines Association (CSLA), which represents foreign carriers operating out of India, has also raised concerns over berthing delays and productivity reductions at the port. “The port remains congested with berthing delays of about 40 hours,” CSLA said. The group further said, “Post cyclone, the move count had dropped from about 27-28 to 21, which has now improved somewhat to about 25 moves per hour.” CSLA added, “As far as port connectivity is concerned, about 80 trains are in the pipeline with the average number of trains being handled daily having dropped from 26-27 to 21.” It went on to point out, “Some vessels are therefore bypassing Mundra and discharging cargo at neighbouring ports for connection on the following vessels. Vessel scheduling is thus getting to be a challenge due to the situation at Mundra, which one hopes will improve sooner rather than later.” While the port authority is making all efforts to bring operations back on track, sources expect the berth congestion and cargo delays to persist for some more days due to substantial backlogs.

"June 29, 2023",Port of Oakland gets “green light” and funding for green power project,"The California Transportation Commission (CTC) voted to provide the Port of Oakland a US$42 million funding for its Green Power Microgrid Project. This project will significantly improve the port's potential to provide green-sourced electricity to its seaport operations, bringing it closer to its zero-emissions target. The Port of Oakland collaborated with Caltrans and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to submit the grant. The project site is within the Port of Oakland seaport complex, and the Californian port will implement the project. The entire cost of the project is US$60 million with the Port of Oakland contributing around US$18 million. The plan is expected to significantly boost the number of heavy-duty vehicles that can be charged at seaport facilities, allowing the Port to charge over 1,000 on- and off-road Zero Emissions Vehicles (ZEVs). The Microgrid, once finished, will also boost the availability of green electricity for ships docked at Oakland and refrigerated cargo in transit at Port facilities. Furthermore, the Microgrid will provide backup power to assist protect the Port of Oakland from regional power outages. The project's supporters propose installing 145 heavy duty/Class 8 electrical chargers in seven places for yard, dockside, on-road and transit vehicle use, boosting the number of ZEVs (zero emissions vehicles) that may be supported from 50 to over 1,000. In addition, solar generation infrastructure will be built to improve green energy capacity for electric vehicles, as well as other facilities and equipment. Furthermore, Battery Energy Storage Systems will provide storage capacity for renewable energy storage at six locations, as well as charging for vehicles and port operations during rolling blackouts in peak energy demand periods.

"June 28, 2023",MSC and small players head Transpacific withdrawals,"MSC and other opportunistic regional carriers have led the retreat in Transpacific capacity, according to Alphaliner’s latest report. As of this month, we have seen 514 ships of 4.86 million TEUs, down from 674 ships of 5.56 million TEUs in June 2022. Most of the withdrawn vessels were from MSC and other long-haul newcomers who exited when the Covid-fuelled boom ended. MSC removed just under 400,000 TEUs or 35% of its Transpacific capacity. By the end of this month, following China United Lines (CULines) decision to axe its China-US West Coast service, all newcomers which joined the trade during the extraordinary years will have retreated, except Swire Shipping. In June 2022, the fleet deployed by newcomers such as CULines, SeaLead Shipping, Pasha Hawaii, Transfar Shipping, TS Lines, BAL Container Line and Shanghai Jin Jiang Shipping comprised nearly 138,800 TEUs (or 2.5% of the total fleet). Fleet capacity deployed between Asia and North America is down 12.6% year-on-year despite overall 5.4% fleet growth in the same period. Maersk and MSC have with their vessel-sharing partner ZIM (for the US East Coast) reduced their joint 2M offering by 7%. The overall capacity withdrawal of MSC and Maersk Line (-19%) is however much higher as they ended standalone loops which were launched during the Covid-19 pandemic to take quick advantage of the booming market. Alphaliner explained, ""It remains remarkable that despite the closure of several services, MSC still deploys more capacity in standalone loops (232,700 TEUs) than in 2M services (145,500 TEUs). MSC thus remains the largest carrier on the trade offering non-alliance services, with a fleet twice as big as the number two, which is Wan Hai Lines. Similar to ZIM, Wan Hai Lines has taken delivery of larger newbuildings which entered the market after it had cooled down. Despite the introduction of five 13,000 TEU newbuildings, the Taiwanese carrier managed to reduce its fleet on the trade by 33% by closing many small loops and only retaining two big loops to/from the US West Coast (AA3) and East Coast (AA7)."" Most of the carriers which entered the Transpacific trade when volumes and freight rates peaked, deployed relatively small tonnage, which are now loss-making as spot freight rates fall below pre-pandemic levels. Asia-US West Coast rates are now down to US$1,200/FEU in mid-June, sharply lower than the US$7,600/FEU seen in June 2022 and US$1,550/FEU in January 2020, before the pandemic. Asia-US East Coast rates have fallen from more than US$10,000/FEU in June last year to US$2,100/FEU today. In comparison, in January 2020, these rates stood at US$2,900/FEU. Martina Li
